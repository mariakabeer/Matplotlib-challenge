For this challenge, I relied heavily on past lectures and solved activities notes from the class github.
When previous examples were not sufficient, I asked question on ChatOpenAi.
I also utilized the website, https://datatofish.com/remove-duplicates-pandas-dataframe/, to explain how to drop duplicate values.
I did not work with any other students.
